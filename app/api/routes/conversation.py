"""Conversation endpoints: start a session, ask, list turns, end.

**The session id travels in the JSON body, never the URL** (guide §20.30). URLs
end up in browser history and access logs; a session id is the key to a
conversation.

**The response already says what happened.** ``rag_used``, ``mcp_used``,
``sources_consulted`` and ``insufficient`` are computed here from the agent's
execution record, so the web page displays them and never re-derives them.

**Failures never leak internals.** An unknown session is 404 with the store's
fixed, id-free message. A tool or provider failure is 502 with a fixed sentence:
exception text from those layers can hold hostnames or provider detail and is
logged by type only.

Route handlers are plain ``def``: the agent is synchronous, and FastAPI runs
``def`` handlers in its threadpool so one slow answer does not block the server.
They are not ``@traced`` (Problems §2); request tracing is Stage 10.

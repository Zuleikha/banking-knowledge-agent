"""Request middleware: one request id and one timing record per HTTP request.

Route handlers cannot be ``@traced`` (see :mod:`app.core.tracing`), so request
tracing lives here, around the whole application (guide §20.34):

1. resolve the request id from ``X-Request-ID`` (guide §20.35);
2. bind it with ``structlog.contextvars`` for the duration of the request, so
   every log and trace line below -- including code running on FastAPI's worker
   threads, which copy the context -- carries it;
3. return it in the ``X-Request-ID`` response header;
4. log ``http.request`` with method, path, status and latency, and update the
   request metrics.

**Only the path is logged**, never the query string or a body: the session id
travels in the JSON body (guide §20.30) and a query string can hold anything.

**An unhandled exception** is logged as ``http.request_failed`` with its type
only -- its message may quote a provider or a tool -- and re-raised, so
Starlette's server-error handler still turns it into a 500. That 500 is built
outside this middleware and therefore carries no ``X-Request-ID`` header; the
log line does.

Written as plain ASGI middleware rather than Starlette's ``BaseHTTPMiddleware``,
which runs the application in a separate task and has a history of context and
streaming surprises.

"""Request-level observability: request ids, content-free fingerprints, metrics.

Stage 10 builds on the two Stage 1 primitives -- structured logging and
``@traced`` -- rather than replacing them (guide §20.32-§20.35):

* **Request id** (§20.34, §20.35). :func:`resolve_request_id` accepts an
  incoming ``X-Request-ID`` only if it is short and safe, and otherwise makes a
  new one. The request middleware binds it with ``structlog.contextvars``, so
  every log and trace line of that request carries it without any function
  having to pass it along.
* **Fingerprints** (§20.32). :func:`fingerprint` is a short one-way hash. The
  question is logged as a fingerprint and a length, never as text: two log lines
  can be matched as "the same question" without the log holding what was asked.
* **Metrics** (§20.33). :class:`Metrics` keeps counters and latency histograms in
  memory, served at ``GET /metrics``. No new dependency: the ``mcp`` /
  ``fastapi`` pins stay untouched. Metrics hold names and numbers only -- never
  a question, an identifier or an answer.

**What is deliberately not ``@traced`` here.** :meth:`Metrics.increment`,
:meth:`Metrics.observe` and :func:`elapsed_ms` run inside the very measurements
they serve, several times per request. Tracing them would write a trace line per
counter bump and add to the latency being measured.

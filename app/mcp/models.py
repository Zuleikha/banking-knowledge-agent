"""Data contracts for the MCP tool layer.

These types are the vocabulary the application uses to talk about *tools*, in the
same way :mod:`app.llm.models` is the vocabulary it uses to talk about models. A
tool implementation's job is to translate between this vocabulary and whatever
synthetic backing data it owns::

    question   --policy-->    ToolInvocation      which tool, with which arguments
    invocation --registry-->  ToolResult          what the tool reported
    results    --prompts-->   a fenced block in the user turn

**Why a tool result is not just a string.** A tool that returned prose would be
indistinguishable, by the time it reached the prompt, from a retrieved document.
The whole point of Stage 6 is that a reader — and the model — can tell *live
information* from *documentation*, so a result carries its own provenance:
which tool produced it, whether the call succeeded, when it was observed, and a
structured payload separate from the one-line human summary.

**Documentation vs. live information.** This is the distinction ``prompt.md`` §14
asks for, and it is a real one, not a label. ``data/knowledge`` says what the
platform is *designed* to do — the documented default of
``limits.atm.per_transaction_amount`` is ``500.00``. A tool says what it is
*reportedly doing now* — this account's
effective limit is ``250.00`` because of an override. Both can be true, and when
they disagree the disagreement is usually the answer to the question. Collapsing
them into one undifferentiated block of context would destroy exactly the
information a support engineer needs.

**Everything here is synthetic.** No tool in this package reaches a real system,
opens a socket, or reads anything outside its own module. That is a property of
the architecture, not a promise about behaviour: there is no code path that
could, which is the same argument Stage 4 made for shipping no vendor adapter.

**Written at integration, not up front, and that is the honest history.** The
contract handed to the six tool authors said only "a stable UPPER_SNAKE code, for
example ``NOT_FOUND``". Four tools used ``NOT_FOUND`` alone; two did not.
``get_system_configuration`` distinguishes ``UNKNOWN_COMPONENT`` from
``UNKNOWN_KEY``, and ``look_up_error_code`` adds ``UNKNOWN_CODE_FOR_COMPONENT``
and ``MALFORMED_CODE``.

The divergence was resolved *upward* rather than flattened to ``NOT_FOUND``,
because the specific codes are genuinely better answers: "that component exists,
that key does not" tells a caller what to try next, and a bare ``NOT_FOUND`` is a
dead end. What was actually wrong was not the vocabulary but that it was
unbounded — nothing stopped a seventh tool inventing ``NO_SUCH_THING``. Closing
the set here, and asserting it in ``tests/test_mcp_tools.py``, keeps the
expressiveness and removes the drift.

Note that ``SECRET_NOT_SERVED`` is not a "not found" at all: it is
``get_system_configuration`` refusing to return a value for a key that looks like
a credential, which the corpus states ConfigurationStore never holds.

A real ``datetime.now()`` here would buy nothing and cost determinism: every
assertion about a tool result would have to exclude the timestamp, and the demo
output would differ between two runs a second apart for no reason a reader could
learn anything from. The data is synthetic, so the clock is synthetic too, and it
says so. When a tool one day reaches a real system, this constant is the thing
that gets replaced by an injected clock — it is deliberately a single named
symbol rather than a literal scattered through six modules.

"""The real MCP protocol server: the same six tools, over stdio.

This module is the *protocol* half of Stage 6. It uses the official ``mcp`` SDK
to expose :mod:`app.mcp.registry`'s tools to any MCP client — Claude Desktop, an
IDE, another agent — over a JSON-RPC stdio transport::

    MCP client
       │  initialize
       │  tools/list   ──▶  ToolRegistry.specs()      ──▶  six tool definitions
       │  tools/call   ──▶  ToolRegistry.call(...)    ──▶  one ToolResult
       ▼
    stdio (JSON-RPC)

**It is a wrapper, not a second implementation.** Every handler below delegates
to the registry. There is no tool logic here, no synthetic data, and no branch
that could make the protocol path answer differently from the in-process one.
That property is the whole reason the module is this thin, and
``tests/test_mcp_server.py`` asserts it by running both paths over the same
questions and comparing the results.

**Why build this at all, when the agent does not use it.** The agent takes the
in-process path deliberately (see :mod:`app.mcp.registry`): a subprocess and a
JSON-RPC round trip between a question and its answer would cost determinism and
speed in a 600-test suite and buy nothing. So this server is not on the critical
path — and it is still worth having, for two reasons. First, "we implemented an
interface shaped like MCP" and "we ran MCP" are different claims, and only the
second is verifiable. Second, the protocol is where the assumptions get tested:
writing it is what forced the tool specs to carry real JSON Schema, forced every
payload to be JSON-serialisable, and forced a decision about how a ``ok=False``
result crosses the wire.

**How a failed lookup crosses the wire.** MCP distinguishes a *tool error*
(``isError=True``) from a successful call. This server maps that boundary the way
:mod:`app.mcp.base` defines it, and not the way the field names tempt you to:

* ``ok=False`` — *no transaction has that reference* — is **not** an error. It is
  a successful call returning a true finding, so ``isError`` stays false and the
  finding is in the content. Marking it an error would tell every client that the
  tool had malfunctioned when in fact it had answered.
* :class:`~app.mcp.base.ToolInputError` and the rest of the taxonomy **are**
  errors, and are reported as such.

**Running it.** ``python -m app.mcp serve``. The transport is stdio, so the
server speaks JSON-RPC on stdin/stdout and must never print anything else there
— which is why logging in this project goes to a file sink and to stderr, never
to stdout.

"""The ``Tool`` seam, and the error taxonomy every tool maps onto.

This module is to tools what :mod:`app.llm.base` is to models, and the symmetry
is deliberate rather than decorative. Both layers face the same problem — an
application that must not learn the shape of whatever is behind the seam — and
solving it the same way twice means a reader who has understood one has already
understood the other.

**Why a protocol rather than an abstract base class.** A tool qualifies
structurally: anything with a ``spec`` and an ``invoke`` is a tool, with no
inheritance, no registration and no import of this module. That is what lets a
test write a three-line hostile tool to prove the injection defence holds,
without that tool being a subclass of anything.

**Why the errors live here and not in each tool.** Six tools were built
independently. If each had invented its own failure type, the registry would
have needed six ``except`` clauses and the agent would have needed to know which
tool it had called in order to interpret the failure. One taxonomy, translated at
the boundary, is the same argument Stage 4 made about vendor SDK exceptions.

**The line between a failure and an error.** This is the most important rule in
the module, and it is easy to get wrong:

* *The thing you asked about does not exist* — an unknown transaction reference,
  an error code that is not in the catalogue, a component nobody has heard of —
  is **data**. It comes back as :class:`~app.mcp.models.ToolResult` with
  ``ok=False``. It is a true, useful answer to a reasonable question.
* *The call itself was wrong or the tool broke* — a required argument missing, an
  argument that cannot be parsed, an unexpected exception inside a tool — is an
  **error**. It raises.

Collapsing the two in either direction does real damage. If "not found" raised,
then asking about a transaction that has been purged would look like an outage.
If a missing argument returned ``ok=False``, a genuine bug in Stage 7's argument
extraction would be silently reported to users as "no such transaction" forever.

    the first tool reaches a real system: the alternative is discovering on that
    day that callers have been treating every tool failure as permanent. Stage 4
    made precisely the opposite mistake by designing an error taxonomy with

"""The in-process tool registry: the MCP layer the agent actually talks to.

``ToolRegistry`` is the ``MCP`` box in ``prompt.md`` §14's diagram::

**Why the registry and not the protocol server is what the agent uses.** There
are two ways into these six tools: this registry, in-process, and
:mod:`app.mcp.server`, which speaks the real MCP protocol over stdio. They are
not two implementations — the server is a thin adapter that calls *this*
registry. The agent takes the in-process path because a subprocess, a JSON-RPC
round trip and an async event loop between a question and its answer would buy
nothing here and cost determinism, speed and offline testability in the 600-test
suite. The protocol path exists because "we built an interface shaped like MCP"
and "we ran MCP" are different claims, and only one of them is testable.

**Registration is explicit, never discovered.** There is no plugin scan, no
``importlib`` walk of the ``tools`` package, no decorator side effect at import
time. :func:`app.mcp.factory.get_tool_registry` names all six. Auto-discovery
would mean the set of tools an agent has depends on which modules happened to be
imported — a difference between a test run and a production run that nothing
declares and no test can see.

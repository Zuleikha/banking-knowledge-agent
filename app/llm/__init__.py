"""LLM abstraction: prompts, context injection, generation, error handling.

Stage 4 owns everything between retrieved evidence and an answer the application
is willing to show::

    RetrievalResult              (Stage 3)
        |
        v  prompts      budget the context, fence it, add the frozen system prompt
      CompletionRequest
        |
        v  base         LLMProvider protocol -- the vendor-agnostic seam
      LLMResponse
        |
        v  service      reject truncated / refused / empty generations
      GroundedAnswer    answer + sources + provenance

Three properties are the point of this package:

**No vendor above this line.** Nothing outside ``app/llm`` imports an SDK, names
a model, or catches a vendor's exception type. Swapping providers is a new module
plus one branch in :mod:`app.llm.factory`.

**The model sees retrieved context, never the knowledge base.** Fifteen documents
would fit in a prompt; that is exactly why the discipline is established now
rather than when it becomes unavoidable.

**No paid call happens unless somebody asks for one, twice.** Stage 5 added two
vendor adapters — Anthropic and OpenAI — so the seam is proved rather than
asserted. The default provider is still :class:`MockLLMProvider`, deterministic
and in-process, and neither adapter can even be *constructed* without
``BKA_LLM_API_KEY``, which is unset. Billing therefore requires two deliberate
changes, and the test suite makes none of them: it mocks the SDK clients, so it
is offline and free by construction rather than by discipline.

The two adapter modules are the only place in this package a vendor is imported,
and a test enforces that on every other module here.

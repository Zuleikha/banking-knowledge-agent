"""The single place the application decides which LLM provider to use.

Mirrors :func:`app.rag.embeddings.get_embedder`: one function, driven by
configuration, so adding a vendor is a new module plus a branch here — never a
change to the service, the agent, or the API layer.

**Three providers are registered, and the default is the free one.**
``BKA_LLM_PROVIDER`` accepts ``mock`` (default), ``anthropic`` and ``openai``.
The default is deliberately unchanged by Stage 5: cloning this repository and
running the suite still costs nothing, and a real API call — a **paid** call —
happens only when somebody deliberately sets that variable *and* supplies a key.
Two properties keep that honest rather than aspirational: the default is
asserted by a test, and neither adapter can be constructed without a key.

**Vendor names appear here; vendor code does not.** The two SDK imports live in
the adapter modules, and are reached through a deferred import inside the branch
that needs one. So this module stays importable — and the whole application
stays runnable on the mock — even if neither SDK is installed. An
:class:`ImportError` from a missing SDK is translated into a configuration
error, because "the package is not installed" is an environment problem and
should read like one.

**An unknown provider is a loud failure, not a fallback.** Falling back to the
mock would be far worse than an error: the application would start, answer
questions, and look entirely healthy while a deterministic stub stood in for a
model — and the only evidence would be a wording change nobody reads.
